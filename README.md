## MIDIO — Self-Test & Assessment Module  

The **Self-Test module** of MIDIO is designed to evaluate a user’s current skill level before starting their interview preparation journey. When a user first opens the website, they are prompted to take an **assessment on soft skills and general knowledge**. Based on their results, MIDIO recommends the right **practice modules and courses** tailored to their needs.

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. User opens MIDIO → prompted with a **Self-Test**.  
2. Test includes:  
   - Soft skills questions (communication scenarios, behavioral questions).  
   - General aptitude & reasoning problems.  
   - Short personality-style questions to gauge confidence and style.  
3. User completes assessment → backend **scores the test**.  
4. Results are mapped to a **learning path**, e.g.:  
   - Low soft skills → focus on communication & mock interviews.
